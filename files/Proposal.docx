Overview

Our Goal is to develop a website, where different sellers will be able to post a product and sell through our website. 
It will give users an opportunity to look for desired items, choose the size, color. 
After choosing that, they can add it to the cart, and keep looking for another item. 
Once they are done with the search, they can go ahead to cart, and proceed with the purchase. 
They can checkout for the purchase as a guest, and won’t be asked for registration. 
They will only need to provide basic information about them (such as Full Name, Address, zip code, phone number). 
Once they are done with the purchase, the product will be processed for delivery. After that the order will be processed to the delivery, and will be delivered to the customer.
